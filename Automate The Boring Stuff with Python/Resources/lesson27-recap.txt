^ means the string must start with pattern, $ means the string must end with the pattern. Both means the entire string must match the entire pattern.
The . dot is a wildcard; it matches any character except newlines.
Pass re.DOTALL as the second argument to re.compile() to make the . dot match newlines as well.
Pass re.I as the second argument to re.compile() to make the matching case-insensitive.
