The shebang line tells your computer that you want to run the script using Python 3.
On Windows, you can bring up the Run dialog by pressing Win+R.
A batch file can save you a lot typing by running multiple commands.
The batch files you'll make will look like this:
    @py C:\Users\Al\MyPytonScripts\hello.py %*
    @pause
You'll need to add the MyPythonScripts folder to the PATH environment variable first.
Command-line arguments can be read in the sys.argv list. (Import the sys module first.)
