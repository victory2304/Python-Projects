Groups are created in regex strings with parentheses.
The first set of parentheses is group 1, the second is 2, and so on.
Calling group() or group(0) returns the full matching string, group(1) returns group 1's matching string, and so on.
Use \( and \) to match literal parentheses in the regex string.
The | pipe can match one of many possible groups.
