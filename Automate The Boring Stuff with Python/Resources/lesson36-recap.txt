The logging module lets you display logging messages.
Log messages create a "breadcrumb trail" of what your program is doing.
After calling logging.basicConfig() to set up logging, call logging.debug(â€˜This is the message') to create a log message.
When done, you can disable the log messages with logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)
Don't use print() for log messages: It's hard to remove the mall when you're done debugging.
The five log levels are: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.
You can also log to a file instead of the screen with the filename keyword argument in the logging.basicConfig() function.
