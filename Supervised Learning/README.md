# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where we train a model on a labelled dataset. Our model learns from seen results taken from the training set and uses it to predict the outcomes of the test set.

In this project the very popular [Iris dataset](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7/raw/0e7a9b0a5d22642a06d3d5b9bcbad9890c8ee534/iris.csv) is used to identify the species of a flower based on its characteristics.
